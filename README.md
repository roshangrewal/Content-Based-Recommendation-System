# Content-Based-Recommendation-System
Building a Movie Recommendation Engine

Future Scope:
1. Our current implementation of the recommender system uses content-based filtering
and doesnâ€™t take into account popularity or ratings of a movie while recommending
movies to a user. Implement a hybrid recommendation system that uses vote_count /
vote_average features from the dataset to provide better recommendations.
2. Which additional features could be used to improve the quality of the recommendation
system? How would you go about deciding which features to use?
